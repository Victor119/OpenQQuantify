Title: AM Modulation

AM = Ac*[1+m*cos(w_m*t)]*cos(w_c*t)

Modulation Waveform = Am*cos(w_m*t)

Carrier Wave = Ac*cos(w_c*t)

m = modulation index = Am / Ac <= 1

When m = 1 (100%), the amplitude of the mod waveform is equal to the carrier amplitude and this results in the deepest modulation where the mod carrier reaches 2*Ac.

cos(wm*t)*cos(wc*t) = 1/2[cos((wm+wc)*t) + cos((wc_wm)*t)]
