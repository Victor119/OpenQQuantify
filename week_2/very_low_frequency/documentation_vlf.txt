Title: BPSK

The data flow graph has been designed considering the following equations: 
C(t) = A * cos(2*π*f_c*t)

The modulation waveform of frequency fm and amplitude M is given by:  

m(t) = A * cos(2*π*f_m*t + π) 

The modulated wave is obtained by considering the following equation:

y(t) = [1 + m(t)] * c(t)
